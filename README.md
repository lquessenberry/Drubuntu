Drubuntu - (newserver.sh)
========

Script that installs packages optimized for Drupal on an Ubuntu server including Apache, NGINX, and PHP as well as some media goodies and other services.

Script originally authored and developed by Clay Freeman - http://github.com/clayfreeman based on a ton of server tweaks and configurations used in developing the perfect Ubuntu OS Drupal Server for Linode VPS Linux Nodes. This script has been tested and works with Ubuntu 12.04, 12.10, and probably a lot more.

Does not require a subscription to Linode.com and runs well on most Ubuntu Server boxes.
